# ============================================================================
# NES core multicycle constraints (sd2snes_nes only -- see nes_wrap.v header)
#
# FOUNDATION (do not touch these numbers without re-deriving BOTH sides):
# ALMOST every sequential element inside the `NES` hierarchy (nes_wrap:nes_core
# | NES:core) is gated by the single clock-enable `ce` generated by nes_wrap's
# SYSCLK pacer. The pacer guarantees a MINIMUM of 13 CLK2 cycles between
# consecutive ce pulses (derivation in nes_wrap.v's header; measured in
# simulation: min 13 under PSRAM stress, min 15 nominal, avg 15.65). The one
# upstream exception (ApuLookupTable's free-running tmp_a/tmp_b) was ce-gated
# in apu.v specifically so the blanket constraint below is sound.
# A SECOND, deliberate exception is rule 6 below: SpriteRAM's OAM M9K schedule
# (ppu.v) runs in the 4 CLK2 after each ce, so ph/pw_*/oam_raw_r are free-running
# and their paths are put back to ONE cycle explicitly.
#
# "ALMOST", and the exceptions matter enough to name: the sd2snes TAPS are
# FREE-RUNNING. ppu.v's tap_* block (~l.785-803) and nes.v's tapA_we (~l.399-418)
# re-register on EVERY CLK2, not on ce. The blanket -setup 4 below is still
# sound, and the argument is the one written at ppu.v ~l.770-784: the tap
# STROBES are ANDed with ce, so they are 1-CLK2 pulses that can only be observed
# in the cycle after a ce; the tap LEVELS re-register the same value every cycle
# while it is stable, and nobody samples them at launch+1 -- their consumers are
# either the capture modules (which only look on a ce, and the psp one now
# registers its inputs first) or the bridge's frame latch (vblank, thousands of
# cycles away). A tap is therefore never the LAUNCH end of a path that this
# constraint has to stretch.
#
# Chosen values (deliberately far below the 13-cycle floor, leaving >3x
# margin so a future pacer tweak does not silently invalidate timing):
#   - internal NES reg->reg:              setup 4  (budget 47.6ns; the
#     unconstrained critical path measured ~24ns, so 4 both closes timing
#     comfortably and keeps a 2x path-growth allowance), hold 3 (restores the
#     hold check to the launch edge, standard N/N-1 pairing).
#   - boundary paths (see per-rule notes): setup 2 / hold 1, each one only
#     where the FSM structure PROVES a full dead cycle between launch and the
#     first capture-of-consequence.
#
# Register name patterns use entity:instance-tolerant wildcards
# ("*|NES:core|*" = everything inside the NES instance).
# ============================================================================

# --- 1. Internal NES core paths (launch ce edge -> capture ce edge >= 13
#        cycles later; claim only 4) ---
set_multicycle_path -setup 4 -from [get_registers {*|NES:core|*}] -to [get_registers {*|NES:core|*}]
set_multicycle_path -hold  3 -from [get_registers {*|NES:core|*}] -to [get_registers {*|NES:core|*}]

# --- 2. NES -> nes_wrap FSM boundary (need_read/need_write, combinational
#        functions of NES regs, sampled by the wrap FSM only in S_IDLE, which
#        is >= 2 cycles after the ce edge that launched them -- S_SETTLE's
#        transition is unconditional/data-independent, so the capture at the
#        intermediate edge is of no consequence) ---
# NOTE on the patterns: nes_core is a TOP-LEVEL instance, so its own registers
# have no "|"-prefixed parent in the netlist name ("nes_wrap:nes_core|state..."),
# and Quartus may re-encode the FSM (one-hot regs named "state.S_IDLE" etc.) --
# hence "state*", not "state[*]", and no leading "*|". A previous revision used
# "*|nes_wrap:..." and was silently IGNORED (STA Warning 332049 "empty
# collection") -- always check main.sta.rpt for 332049/332174 after touching
# these.
# REMOVED, because it was NOT TRUE.  Counted edge by edge: `ce_pulse_r <= 1` is
# assigned in S_PACE, so ce is HIGH during the S_SETTLE cycle, and
# core_ce == ce_pulse_r drives the NES instance directly -- a core register
# LAUNCHES on the S_SETTLE -> S_IDLE edge.  The FSM is in S_IDLE for exactly one
# cycle (it always leaves, to S_REQ or to S_PACE), so its capture of
# need_read/need_write is the END of that same S_IDLE cycle: LAUNCH + 1, not
# launch + 2.  The rule claimed one cycle it did not have.
# The proof it was never load-bearing is right next door: `req_is_ppu` is the
# SAME cone, was simply forgotten from the list, and closes SINGLE-CYCLE at
# +0.628.  If a seed ever fails to close without these, the answer is
# STRUCTURAL (an S_SETTLE2 dead cycle), never a constraint.

# --- 2b. OPEN QUESTION on rules 2 and 3, raised while closing the Fase 3 fit.
#     Read the pacer FSM edge by edge (nes_wrap.v): `ce_pulse_r <= 1` is
#     assigned in S_PACE, so ce is HIGH during the S_SETTLE cycle, and
#     core_ce == ce_pulse_r drives the NES instance directly.  A core register
#     therefore LAUNCHES on the S_SETTLE -> S_IDLE edge.  The FSM is in S_IDLE
#     for exactly one cycle (it always leaves, to S_REQ or to S_PACE), so its
#     capture-of-consequence for need_read/need_write is the END of that S_IDLE
#     cycle -- i.e. LAUNCH + 1 period, not launch + 2.
#     If that reading is right, the `-setup 2` of rules 2/3 claims one cycle
#     more than the structure proves.  It has been closing and running in
#     silicon, so either the reading is wrong or the paths simply have enough
#     margin that the over-claim never bit.  NOT changed here -- flagged so it
#     is checked deliberately rather than inherited.  It is also the reason the
#     Fase 3 fit did NOT add a `-setup 2 ... -to ST_MEM_DELAYr[*]`: extending an
#     unproven claim to a new endpoint is how a silent silicon bug is born.  The
#     core -> ST_MEM_DELAYr path was removed STRUCTURALLY instead, in
#     nes_wrap.v's ROM_FREE_SLOT.

# --- 3. NES -> main.v arbiter address/data capture (mem_addr/mem_dout change
#        only on a ce edge; NES_ROM_ADDRr/DATAr capture-of-consequence happens
#        when NES_ROM_RRQ/WRQ is observed high, which is >= 3 cycles after
#        that ce edge -- claim 2) ---
#     PROVEN AND LOAD-BEARING (unlike rule 2, which was neither).  The launch is
#     the S_SETTLE -> S_IDLE edge, the FSM raises RRQ/WRQ at the end of S_IDLE
#     and main.v samples it one cycle later, so the capture is launch + 2
#     EXACTLY.  And it is carrying weight: the worst path of the whole device
#     is inside it (PPU|SpriteSet|sprite5|x_coord[1] -> NES_ROM_DATAr[7],
#     relationship 23.808 ns, slack +0.235).  Do not touch it. ---

# --- 4. nes_wrap -> NES read-data return (mem_rdata_cpu_r/_ppu_r latched on the
#        S_WAIT->S_PACE edge; the earliest ce edge that lets the NES capture
#        it is >= 2 cycles later, because S_PACE always spends >= 1 full cycle
#        before ce_pulse_r can rise) ---
#     EXACT AND WITHOUT MARGIN.  The ">= 1 full cycle in S_PACE" is the whole
#     claim: moving the `ce_pulse_r <= 1'b1` assignment into the S_WAIT branch
#     (an obvious-looking way to save a cycle of latency) would make the capture
#     launch + 1 and BREAK this rule.  If the pacer is ever restructured, this
#     is the constraint to re-derive first. ---

#     por ce_tick o edge-detect dispara NA PROPRIA BORDA DE ce, nao 1 CLK2
#     depois), e o core consome joypad_data apenas sob o PROXIMO ce
#     (>=13 CLK2 depois -- piso do pacer, ver header do nes_wrap.v). Mesmo
#     par setup-2/hold-1 dos mem_rdata. (STA pos-janela-CHR: pior caminho
#     sr2[0] -> APU DmcChan|IrqEnable, -0.058ns single-cycle.)

set_multicycle_path -setup 2 -from [get_registers {nes_wrap:nes_core|nes_bridge:bridge|sr1[*] nes_wrap:nes_core|nes_bridge:bridge|sr2[*]}] -to [get_registers {*|NES:core|*}]

# --- 4c. sr* -> main.v arbiter, the THROUGH path.  The rule above stops at the
#     core boundary and rule 3 starts there, so a path that LAUNCHES at sr* and
#     lands on NES_ROM_ADDRr/DATAr -- crossing the core combinationally on the
#     way -- was covered by NEITHER and stayed single-cycle.  It surfaced as the
#     worst path of the device once the earlier violations were cleared:
#     bridge|sr2[7] -> NES_ROM_DATAr[5], -0.318.
#     It is legitimate for exactly the same reason as rule 3 -- launch on a ce
#     edge, capture when NES_ROM_RRQ/WRQ is observed, >= 2 cycles later -- but
#     ONLY BECAUSE BOTH EDGES on which the sr* can change are now ce edges --
#     the WHOLE joypad block is paced by ce_tick.  Before that, the reload moved
#     on SNES_WR_end (the SNES writing the control block, unrelated to the
#     pacer) and the SHIFT moved one CLK2 after the clock's falling edge, which
#     is launch+1: this constraint would have been another lie on BOTH counts,
#     and gating only the reload fixed only half of it.  The pacing is what
#     makes the claim true; do not keep one without the other. ---

# --- 5. mcu_cmd nes_feat_out (CHIPFEAT 0xef) -> NES core: quasi-static
#        configuration. This register now carries the FULL mapper_flags[15:0]
#        word (Fase 0 replaced the old MAPPER_BUF placeholder wiring -- see
#        main.v's nes_wrap instantiation). Same rationale as the original
#        MAPPER_BUF false path it supersedes: STA showed the config->
#        MultiMapper decode -> prg_allow -> from_data_bus -> APU/CPU register
#        D-input cone as the sole failing group (~-1.2ns at 85C), and the word
#        is written only by the MCU during game load (src/memory.c writes
#        CHIPFEAT before assert/deassert_reset), while the NES core is held in
#        or before its reset (SNES_reset_strobe) -- stable for the core's
#        entire runtime, so no synchronous timing relationship to the core's
#        ce-gated captures exists or is needed. OPERATIONAL CONTRACT this
#        false path encodes: firmware must never re-program CHIPFEAT while the
#        NES core is running. Scoped -to the core only, so any other consumer
#        of nes_feat_out stays fully timed.

# --- 6. EXCEPTION TO THE FOUNDATION: the OAM M9K of SpriteRAM (ppu.v) ---
#     SpriteRAM time-shares ONE true-dual-port M9K (nes_oamram) between the primary
#     OAM, the frozen copy for the bridge and the secondary OAM.  Its port-A
#     schedule runs in the 4 CLK2 that FOLLOW each ce edge, so a few registers in
#     there are FREE-RUNNING on CLK2 -- they are NOT gated by ce, and the blanket
#     "-setup 4" of rule 1 would over-claim for them:
#       ph[*]               phase counter (0 idle, 1 write, 2 read OAM, 3 read secondary)
#       pw_we/pw_a[*]/pw_d[*]  the $2004 write, captured at the ce edge, issued in ph 1
#       oam_raw_r[*]        the OAM byte, captured in ph 3 from the M9K output
#     Every path that LEAVES ph/pw_* (address/enable/data of the M9K, the capture
#     enable of oam_raw_r) and the path M9K output -> oam_raw_r is a genuine ONE-cycle
#     path (launch and capture are consecutive CLK2 edges), so they are put back to
#     the plain single-cycle relationship (setup 1 / hold 0): the STA analyses them
#     with the real period and a future re-synthesis that stretches one of them
#     fails timing instead of silently passing on a 4-cycle budget.
#     The M9K address/enable registers also get a TRUE bound for the paths that
#     come from ce-gated registers (oam_ptr, sprtemp_ptr...): the M9K samples the
#     oam_ptr address two edges after the ce that moved it (ph 2), so the honest
#     claim there is setup 2 / hold 1, not 4.
#     Everything else that touches this M9K keeps rule 1 (setup 4) ON PURPOSE and
#     it is sound: the data written through port A at a ce edge (oam_bus, the
#     secondary-OAM write) comes from ce-gated registers and a_q, which has been
#     stable since ph 0 (4 CLK2 after the previous ce, >= 9 CLK2 before the next).
#     Order matters: these come AFTER rule 1 and are narrower; check on the STA
#     report that "Multicycle - Setup End" reads 1 on ph/pw_* paths (and 2 on the
#     M9K address paths), and that the collections below are not empty (the error()
#     makes a rename fail loudly instead of becoming a silent 332049).
